"""The tool catalog: every enabled upstream's tools under their exposed names, cached.

tools/list is answered from this cache only and never waits on an upstream. Each upstream
has its own background task that refreshes it on a short-lived connection, under its own
timeout: every refresh interval when it is healthy, with exponential backoff when it is
not. A hung upstream therefore delays only itself. Newly registered upstreams are noticed
within seconds.

A failed refresh makes the upstream unavailable: its tools disappear until it answers
again, so clients never see stale descriptions for a server that may have changed.
